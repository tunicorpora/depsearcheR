DepsearcheR --  querying syntactically annotated data with R
============================================================

This simple library aims to provide some basic functionality for
analyzing dependency annotated data with R.

Checkout the documentation at [https://utacorpora.github.io/depsearcheR/](https://utacorpora.github.io/depsearcheR/).

Installation
============

Use either the `devtools` package, or - if devtools isn't installed, then
probably preferably - the more lightweight `remotes` package. Both 
have  the `install_github` function needed to do the job:

```r
library(remotes)
install_github('utacorpora/depsearcheR')
```
